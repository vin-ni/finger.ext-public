This project was developed during the summer semester 2024 as part of the Cognitive Augmentation class in the Fluid Interfaces Research Group at the MIT Media Lab. I would like to thank Prof. Pattie Maes, Samantha Chan, and Nathan Whitmore for their feedback, guidance and help to fund the prototyping hardware.
